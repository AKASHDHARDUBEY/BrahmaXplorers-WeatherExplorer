# BrahmaXplorers-WeatherApp

A web application that uses NASA Earth observation data to predict the likelihood of specific weather conditions for a selected location and date, helping users plan outdoor activities with personalized forecasts. Built with React, Python, and data visualization tools.

## 🌦️ Project Summary

If you’re planning an outdoor event—like a vacation, a hike, or fishing—a weather prediction tool can help. This app uses NASA Earth observation data and historical weather datasets to show the probability of conditions like “very hot,” “very cold,” “very windy,” “very wet,” or “very uncomfortable” for the location and day of the year you select.  

By visualizing trends and probabilities, users can make better-informed decisions for their outdoor activities.

## 🚀 Features

- Select a location using a map or search bar.
- View probability of weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind, air quality, etc.).
- Interactive charts and graphs for visualizing weather probabilities.
- Option to download the relevant data as CSV or JSON.
- User-friendly interface for both casual and advanced users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI)  
- **Database:** MySQL / MongoDB  
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js / D3.js  
- **APIs & Data Sources:** NASA Earth Observation Data, OpenWeatherMap (optional for real-time data)  
- **Machine Learning:** (Optional) AI/ML models to enhance probability estimates

## 🎯 How It Works

1. User selects a location and date.  
2. The app fetches historical NASA weather datasets for the selected parameters.  
3. Calculates probabilities of various weather conditions using historical trends.  
4. Displays interactive charts, maps, and summary statistics.  
5. Users can download the data for offline analysis.
